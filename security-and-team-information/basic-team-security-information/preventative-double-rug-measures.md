# Preventative Double Rug Measures

Our team is actively working to add new security features to prevent perpetual fraud by malicious devs from these rugged projects. 

Rugged token amounts in a users wallet will not positively or negatively affect their ability to enter the grave.  This makes it unattractive for a bad actor to mint a surplus of their token in order to enter our graves. Scammers are creative and always coming up with ways to take advantage of the DeFi community, and our team is working hard to provide unique ways to resurrect your rugged tokens in a way that makes sense based on the features of each dead project.
