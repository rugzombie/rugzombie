# Preventative Double Rug Measures

Our team is actively working to add new security features to prevent perpetual fraud by malicious devs from these rugged projects. The most obvious feature of a rugged project is a minting function in the code. In that instance, a malicious dev would be able to mint new tokens once listed in our tombs in an effort to remove $ZMBE from the liquidity pool. For this reason, rugged tokens with mint functions will be ineligible for our tombs in order to protect users from being “double-rugged” by developers who still control a minting feature in their token contract. We have some unique ideas for rugged projects with minting functions, stay tuned for more!

Additionally, rugged tokens will also be prevented from participating in our Tombs where it is discovered that a malicious dev is still in control of the large portion of the rugged token's circulating supply. Scammers are creative and always coming up with ways to take advantage of the DeFi community, and our team is working hard to provide unique ways to resurrect your rugged tokens in a way that makes sense based on the features of each dead project.
