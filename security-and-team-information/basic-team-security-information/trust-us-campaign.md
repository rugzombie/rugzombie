# TRUST US CAMPAIGN

![](../../.gitbook/assets/wewanttrust.jpg)

The RugZombie is committed to earning the trust of our users. DeFi can be a hellish landscape for new projects. There are so many variables, and often development is pitted against community perception. 

In August of 2021, The RugZombie team committed to an overhaul of transparency, trust and security related matters for our team and platform including a campaign that includes: 

* [ ] Locking Our Migrator Code with a Custom TimeLock/SafeOwner Code
* [ ] KYC for our core founders with an outside firm
* [x] KYC for all contract devs on our platform utilizing [blockpass](https://blockpass.org/)
* [ ] Announcing and Subsequently Locking our Liquidity
* [ ] AMA with a well known and established Crypto Group, along with increased public visibility for our core team
* [ ] Some interesting [MAUSOLEUM](../../basic-information/main-features/mausoleum.md) pieces to celebrate our progress
* [ ] Some Sponsored Press through trusted media outlets about our project

We hope these efforts will further offer our current and future users trust on our platform. We take pride in being transparent \(if not a bit irreverent\) regarding our platform.
