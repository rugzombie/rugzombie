# Flash Loan Protection

Due to the recent increase in flash loan attacks on the Binance Smart Chain, our team desired to be above reproach in our security measures to prevent manipulation of our token and exploitation from hackers. 

To begin with, our price feed data uses ChainLink \(LINK\) to provide aggregate sources of price feed data, reducing the likelihood of flash loan attacks.

In addition to this, as our project sees success, we will utilize some of our allocated treasury resources for further audits, protections, and currently are considering working with peckshield, a leading blockchain security firm.
