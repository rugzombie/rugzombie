# Basic Security Information

While our team has chosen to remain anonymous to the public, we will have doxed with one another before launch, and have set up a number of security features that we believe will generate trust from token holders:

●  Good Code: Our code is transparently placed on [GitHub](../../other-links/contracts.md) and available for you to review;

●  [Audits](audits.md): Beginning with TechRate \(before launch\) and eventually Certik and others. Audits don’t make a project safe, but they show good-faith effort by developers because audits cost money and time. We will also welcome community audits through active crypto community voices and plan to acquire a few of these.

●  [Migration code removed](migrator-code.md), time-lock features enabled

●  [Initial LP Time-Locked](time-lock.md) and [emergency withdraw feature](emergency-withdraw.md)

●  [Multi-signature treasury wallet](../../tokenomics/initial-token-supply.md#treasury-funds) and [vested developer tokens](../../tokenomics/initial-token-supply.md#developer-vested-tokens) with timelock

●  [Flash Loan Protection Features](../flash-loan-protection.md)

●  Future option to dox or KYC with selected incubators and/or exchanges;

and eventually 

●  Community Governance to further de-risk our platform

## Why Anonymous Team \(we know, it sounds bad\)

While a generally accepted practice in DeFi, anonymous teams create a risk for all parties involved, especially end users of tokens. Many rugged projects have anonymous teams which allow them to act in bad faith toward their token holders without risk.

At the same time, our team knows the unique problems facing developers and see the risk doxed devs carry as a result for their transparency. There is no simple solution. Anonymity allows us to really rely on the strength of our code, added security features, and decentralized efforts, while protecting our personal lives from being harassed by some of you unsavory folk \(you know who you are\).

 It also requires that token holders do their own due diligence and research before buying or selling in a risky market like cryptocurrency. 

## How Many Are on the Team? 

Our team is a combination of core developers/founders \(dr. frankensteins\), contract workers, and community leaders \(undertakers\).

Our core dev team has 3 members currently, and we are actively adding more as our project grows. 

We have a number of community leaders and experts who actively manage our socials, SEO and web traffic, marketing, partnerships, design and other efforts.
