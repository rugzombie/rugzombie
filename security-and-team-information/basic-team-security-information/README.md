# Basic Security Information

While our team has chosen to remain anonymous to the public, we will have doxed with one another before launch, and have set up a number of security features that we believe will generate trust from token holders:

●  Good Code: Our code is transparently placed on [GitHub](../../other-links/contracts.md) and available for you to review;

●  [Audits](audits.md): Beginning with TechRate \(before launch\) and eventually Certik and others. Audits don’t make a project safe, but they show good-faith effort by developers because audits cost money and time. We will also welcome community audits through active crypto community voices and plan to acquire a few of these.

●  [emergency withdraw feature](emergency-withdraw.md) \(in case of DDOS attack\)

●  [Multi-signature treasury wallet](../../tokenomics/initial-token-supply.md#treasury-funds) and [vested developer tokens](../../tokenomics/initial-token-supply.md#developer-vested-tokens) with timelock for 30 days

●  [Flash Loan Protection Features](../flash-loan-protection.md)

●  Future option to dox or KYC with selected incubators and/or exchanges;

and eventually 

●  Community Governance \(eventually\) to further de-risk our platform

## Why Anonymous Team \(we know, it sounds bad\)

While a generally accepted practice in DeFi, anonymous teams create a risk for all parties involved, especially end users of tokens. Many rugged projects have anonymous teams which allow them to act in bad faith toward their token holders without risk.

At the same time, our team knows the unique problems facing developers and see the risk doxed devs carry as a result for their transparency. There is no simple solution. Anonymity allows us to really rely on the strength of our code, added security features, and decentralized efforts, while protecting our personal lives from being harassed by some of you unsavory folk \(you know who you are\).

 It also requires that token holders do their own due diligence and research before buying or selling in a risky market like cryptocurrency. 

## How Many Are on the Team? 

Our team is a combination of core developers/founders \(dr. frankensteins\), contract workers, and community leaders \(undertakers\).

Our core dev team has 3 members currently, and we are actively adding more as our project grows. 

We have a number of community leaders and experts who actively manage our socials, SEO and web traffic, marketing, partnerships, design and other efforts.

## What About all the Other Contract Features?

There are a lot of contract features that certain defi projects have eliminated or locked upon launch. They do this to give public assurance that they are not a scam. This is admirable, however, these features are in the code for a reason and to eliminate them or lock them comes with significant drawbacks.

#### Migrator Code

For instance, goose finance was the first to remove the migrator code on the BSC. This feature allows for upgrade in the future of a project, and removing it is basically like saying a project does not intend to upgrade to a future version. Our project is a long term project, so we are doing what is best for the project, even if it goes against the norm for new BSC projects. Other notable projects that have kept this code are Pancakeswap and Sushiswap.

#### Locked Liquidity

Our liquidity at launch will be very low to begin with, so locking our own liquidity is not actually that helpful. And besides, locked liquidity eventually gets unlocked and relocked, in and endless cycle. Our team is putting our blood, sweat and tears into this thing. 

Locked liquidity and burned liquidity addresses left an entire generation of projects on v1 of pancakeswap. We do intend to limit ourselves in this manner. 

At the end of the day, community trust and confidence are important to us, but so is doing what is right for the project. We will not add/remove features that will prevent future growth because early token holders need assurance. We expect our community to do their own research and due diligence.
