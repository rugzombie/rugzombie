# üèò The Zombie Alliance

Web3 Projects within the Zombie Alliance will receive a dashboard within The Hub where users can learn about their project. Through Task Farming, the Zombie DAO and it's members are incentivised to improve the quality of and find potential vulnerabilities in Alliance protocols. This makes projects within the alliance a much safer investment, eligible for promotion within The Hub and marked as a safe investment for new investors by existing members.

#### Increased Security

Projects will be given a security score, which is an aggregation of the security of their Smart Contracts, Frontend, Backend stack, etc. This will be verified on admission to the Alliance and recurringly afterwards by our ecosystem devs.

#### Ecosystem Spotlight

Different Alliance protocols will occasionally recieve articles, video and other media content, providing a deep dive into the protocol and showcasing newly released features. This content will be done by the DAO's writers and media managers and will be showcased on the homepage of The Hub. We aim to provide awareness of Alliance projects but our goal is to remain unbiased and transparent when doing so, the DAO will re-elect content creators if suspected otherwise.

We are working with ecosystem partners to develop some excellent content and provide a way for our spotlights to be fairly and equitably displayed for all.&#x20;

#### Investment Quizzes

The DAO will work with the Alliance projects to create investment quizes that test investors knowledge on a the project. This ensures users fully understand a project's purpose, tokenomics and risks associated with their investments.

#### Passive Audits

Alliance projects are eligible for passive audits from community devs. The DAO will reward those who find vulnerabilities or areas for improvement within your protocol. This includes audits on new features added to your protocol, but projects can expedite audits by burning ZMBE.
