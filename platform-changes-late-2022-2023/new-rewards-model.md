# ðŸª™ New Rewards Model

The past year in defi has shown that providing high emissions for simply staking tokens is not sustainable for most projects, as the burden always lies on the token holders and consistent trading activity combined with viral growth marketing.

Projects that rely on marketing and yield farming for their primary value inevitably lose value as the more competitors enter the market, better and newer products, and hype fades while other projects come on the scene. Rewarding users for "staking" may seem like the best way to keep people in the ecosystem, but inevitably leads to enormous pressure on projects to grow for the sake of growth, without adding any value to the protocol or to the ecosystem as a whole.&#x20;

These farms are not bad, but they dis-incentivize building strong healthy projects with long term use cases and innovation, and instead aim to make a quick dollar for their users.&#x20;

RugZombie was never started as a yield farm, yet, many users have treated the project as such.&#x20;

**A New Way Forward**&#x20;

&#x20;We've created a new model where users will earn ZMBE through Task/Participation Farming within The Hub.&#x20;

Through [Task Farming](new-rewards-model.md#task-farming), ZMBE will be earned by performing tasks that improve The Hub and the web3 space as a whole. Grave NFT emissions will remain as before, and ZMBE emissions will be reduced by 75% to compensate for Task Farming emissions.&#x20;

In addition to the rewards for tasks, an equal amount of ZMBE will be burned for each task completed, thus ensuring that every task not only rewards the doer, but reduces our supply over time, creating deflationary pressure on the token supply.

To achieve bear market resistance, it's important that we create a community that values work and the impact they created in opposition to staking as the sole driver of activity in the project.

&#x20;This model will help us build an unstoppable community that gets stuff done and introduces a sustainable model for the Zombie Token which will power the ecosystem.

#### DAO Roles

In addition to task farming, community members can take on roles crucial for the operations of the DAO and receive a recurring ZMBE salary in return (You can read more about these roles in The Zombie DAO):

* [#media-manager](the-zombie-dao.md#media-manager "mention")
