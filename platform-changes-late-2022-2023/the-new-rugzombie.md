# ðŸ¥³ The New RugZombie

When initially launching RugZombie we envisioned it was a fun NFT project with a goal to provide catharsis to victims of scams and exploits in our space. Since our launch, we're proud of the impact our platform has had in the communities we've helped and built along the way.

#### Our motivation

Despite our efforts, the Web3 space is still very unsafe for the average investor: **this needs to change.**  We want RugZombie to be a proactive and leading force in the prevention of exploits and rug-pulls, and not a reactionary effort after a scam.

#### Platform Upgrades

To achieve our ambitions and level of impact we want to have on the space, we'll need the community's help. The power of web3 is the community, and together, we can make crypto safe:&#x20;

This is why we're introducing The Zombie DAO and the following platform upgrades:

* The Zombie DAO - Zombie holders can create and vote on proposals within the Hub
* New rewards model - Will reward those for improving the safety of the Web3 space
* The Zombie Alliance - Partner projects / protocols that are protected by the DAO
* THE HUB - The central user-facing product the DAO provides. This is a research and educational platform that provides transparent and safe means for  users to navigate and new users onboard into the web3 space.
