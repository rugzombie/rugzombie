# Deposit Fees

We have chosen to use deposits in BNB rather than $ZMBE in order to reduce sell pressure on $ZMBE.&#x20;

The deposit fee for Graves are a flat fee taken in BNB but represented in BUSD around \~5 USD.&#x20;

50% of all fees are used to immediately buy back $ZMBE and burn thereby reducing the supply.

The rest of the fees are sent to the treasury in order to pay for things related to the project such as the NFT artists, audits, and future features, [adding developers to our team](../security-and-team-information/join-our-team-of-dr.-frankensteins.md).&#x20;

The treasury wallet address can be seen here:&#x20;
