# Deposit Fees

We have chosen to use deposits in BNB rather than $ZMBE in order to reduce sell pressure on $ZMBE. If we were to take $ZMBE for these deposit fees, in order to pay our artists, devs, audits and more, we would subsequently need to sell $ZMBE for BNB or BUSD. While this may contribute to price action, it will inevitably result to consistent sell pressure on our token. 

The deposit fee for Graves are a flat fee taken in BNB but represented in BUSD around ~5 USD. 

50% of all fees are used to immediately buy back $ZMBE and burn thereby reducing the supply.

The rest of the fees are sent to the treasury in order to pay for things related to the project such as the NFT artists, audits, and future features, [adding developers to our team](../security-and-team-information/join-our-team-of-dr.-frankensteins.md). 

The treasury wallet address can be seen here: 

Our Tombs and Crypts take a percentage rather than a flat fee; we thought this was a more fair way of managing these features until we establish plans for our own AMM. 

If and when we launch our own AMM, these fees will likely be reduced or go away entirely. Thanks for your support.
