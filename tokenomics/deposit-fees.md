# Deposit Fees

We have chosen to use deposits in BNB rather than $ZMBE in order to reduce sell pressure on $ZMBE. If we were to take $ZMBE for these deposit fees, in order to pay our artists, devs, audits and more, we would subsequently need to sell $ZMBE for BNB or BUSD \(or risk them converting $ZMBE and doing the same\). While buying/selling $ZMBE may contribute to price action, it will inevitably result to consistent sell pressure on our token. 

The deposit fee for Graves are a flat fee taken in BNB but represented in BUSD around ~5 USD. 

50% of all fees are used to immediately buy back $ZMBE and burn thereby reducing the supply.

The rest of the fees are sent to the treasury in order to pay for things related to the project such as the NFT artists, audits, and future features, [adding developers to our team](../security-and-team-information/join-our-team-of-dr.-frankensteins.md). 

The treasury wallet address can be seen here:

If or when we launch our own AMM, these fees will likely be reduced or go away entirely. Thanks for your support in the meantime. You are helping keep $ZMBE undead.
