# Early Withdraw Fees

To keep and incentivize liquidity and to punish arbitrage and harvesting bots, all graves, tombs and spawning pools have an early withdraw fee assessed if removed prematurely. 

This 5% fee will be immediately sent to the treasury upon early removal. Some of those funds will be used for periodic buy-back and burns, among other things. [See the use of our treasury funds here](initial-token-supply.md#treasury-funds).

This fee applies to both harvesting and initial deposits. The withdraw period is:

**48 Hours on all initially deposited funds** 

**2 Hours for all farming rewards**

This timer is reset upon each deposit and withdraw of to [de-incentive whales](whale-taxes-de-incentives-early-withdraw-fees.md) and incentivize long term holding.

This timer can be suspended upon consent of the dev team.
