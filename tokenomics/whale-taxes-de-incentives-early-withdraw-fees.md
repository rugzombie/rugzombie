# Whale Taxes / De-incentives / Early Withdraw Fees

## Whale Tax on LP Removal

Whether a project starts with a presale or a fair launch, BSC projects fall prey to large wallet holders who, whether meaningfully or not, affect price action on the open market. This is a short term issue that is nearly unavoidable on new tokens. While we are a long term project \(and not worried about short term price action\) we are mindful that the first weeks and months of a new project are extremely important for its success.

Our team was thoughtful about balancing the fair and open nature of a financial market and restricting major market manipulation by whales. 

Rather than restricting whales completely \(who can bring much needed liquidity to the market\), we have chosen instead to apply a whale tax of 8% on liquidity removal of more than 5% of the total supply. 

This 8% will immediately return to locked liquidity in the ZMBE-BNB pool forever raising the price floor. So each whale that dumps will leave the community with a gift of an increasing price floor that is locked.

As our market matures, we may need to change the tax rate, so please stay updated on the most relevant information. 

## De-Incentives

In addition to our whale tax, all graves and tombs have an early withdraw fee of .5% for withdrawing deposits prematurely. This timer resets whenever the total amount of ZMBE removed is more than 2% of total supply, thereby reducing the frequency of removing LP. This additionally de-incentivizes whales from removing just below the whale tax threshold in smaller amounts. 

This early withdraw fee is explained in depth below, and applies to all graves, tombs and spawning pools regardless of amount staked.

## Early Withdraw Fees

To keep and incentivize liquidity and to punish arbitrage and harvesting bots, all graves, tombs and spawning pools have an early withdraw fee assessed if removed prematurely. 

This .5% fee will be immediately sent to the treasury upon early removal. Some of those funds will be used for periodic buy back and burns, among other things. [See the use of our treasury funds here](initial-token-supply.md#treasury-funds).

This fee applies to both harvesting and initial deposits. The withdraw period is:

48 Hours on all deposited funds 

2 Hours for all farming rewards

This timer is reset if more than 2% of supply is withdrawn to de-incentive whales.
