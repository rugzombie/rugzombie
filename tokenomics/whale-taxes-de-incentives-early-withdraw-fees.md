## Whale Tax on LP Removal

Whether a project starts with a presale or a fair launch, BSC projects fall prey to large wallet holders who, whether meaningfully or not, affect price action on the open market. This is a short term issue that is nearly unavoidable on new tokens. While we are a long term project \(and not worried about short term price action\) we are mindful that the first weeks and months of a new project are extremely important for its success.

Our team was thoughtful about balancing the fair and open nature of a decentralized financial market and restricting major market manipulation by whales. 

Rather than restricting whales completely \(who can bring much needed liquidity to the market\), we have chosen instead to apply a whale tax of 8% on liquidity removal of more than 5% of the total supply. 

This 8% will immediately return to locked liquidity in the ZMBE-BNB pool forever raising the price floor. So each whale that dumps will leave the community with a gift of an increasing price floor that is locked.

As our market matures, we may need to change the tax rate, so please stay updated on the most relevant information. 

## De-Incentives

In addition to our whale tax, all graves and tombs have an early withdraw fee of 5% for withdrawing deposits prematurely.

 This timer resets whenever any amount of $ZMBE is removed from supply, thereby reducing the frequency of removing LP. This additionally de-incentivizes whales from removing just below the whale tax threshold in smaller amounts. 

This early withdraw fee is [explained in depth here](early-withdraw-fees.md), and applies to all graves, tombs and spawning pools regardless of amount staked, so be mindful when entering and exiting our pools.

## Incentives - Whale Grave

Whales are not bad. There is a common misconception in the crypto-space that whales are only about manipulation. While whales have the ability to do that, we did not want to wholly de-incentivize them from our platform as many whales are good actors with a desire to promote adoption of cryptocurrency  projects. Whales provide needed liquidity and are crucial to long term success if they believe in the project and are willing to hold. 

We have created a custom [GRAVE](../basic-information/main-features/graves/) for whales that employs a unique long term reward structure for whales who are acting in a positive, good faith manner. Rather than punish such people, we desired to incentivize good whale behavior.

 About the $ZMBE Whale Grave:

* Initial LP Deposit Amount has a minimum threshold of ~25000 BUSD
* The Withdraw Fee is increased to 10% on Whale Grave 
* The Whale Tax still applies
* The Withdraw Fee timer is increased to 30 Days
* Each deposit or withdraw from the Whale Grave resets the 30 Day timer

In exchange for their long-term view on the project, whale grave providers will be issued a custom WHALE PASS NFT that will include perks. \(details of the pass are in development\) 

* A CUSTOM WHALE PASS NFT
* Exclusive Access to a Whale Auction Event
