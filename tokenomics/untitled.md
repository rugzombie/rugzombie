## Why ZMBE has no hard capped supply?

$ZMBE at its core is a simple yield-farming token allowing the user to earn new tokens out of their rugged tokens. Our mission is simple; providing new value to our users through resurrecting rugged or dead projects with this new yield in $ZMBE.

As $ZMBE is a farming token, it is inflationary and has no fixed supply, but the circulating supply will be controlled by a variety of unique burning features:

●  Burning $ZMBE tokens when used to unlock Graves and Tombs;

●  Our buyback and burn program \(we will sell the rugged tokens that have been deposited to unlock our Tombs and then use the proceeds to buyback $ZMBE to be burned\);

●  Manually burning $ZMBE from Treasury as needed;

●  Auctions and contests where a portion of the $ZMBE used to participate will be burned. Specifics of these projects will be released as they arrive.

In addition to utilizing $ZMBE to recover loss from rugged tokens, users are incentivized to HODL due to our burning and staking mechanisms that will increase the value of $ZMBE over time. Additionally, in the future, $ZMBE HODLers will have the ability to receive NFTs, possible airdrops and participate in governance and more.

**Inflationary supply can be a cause for concern for potential users of $ZMBE, however the way our project incentivizes liquidity provision is by giving out rewards that require an emission rate, thereby increasing the supply. $ZMBE is also used in future features with our gaming ecosystem \(coming ~Q1 2022\) and there are MANY ways to control the supply as stated above.** **Please trust our team as we build something great here.**

We have many burning mechanism, staking mechanisms and more that will lead to $ZMBE being emission neutral. If anything, we may need to _increase_ the emission rate rather than decrease due to high demand and how useful $ZMBE will be in all our ecosystems.But as the chart below demonstrates, $ZMBE is among some of the lowest emissions you will find in farming projects.
