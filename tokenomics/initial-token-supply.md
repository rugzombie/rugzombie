# Initial Token Supply

## Liquidity Provision

80% of all our tokens will be in initial liquidity contract at fair launch. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Why not burned wallet address/locked LP? As the transition of pancakeswap to version 2 demonstrated  recently for many projects on PCS, burned/locked wallet addresses can really destroy a project. Our team wanted the ability to adjust to any issues that may arise over the course of time with new versioning of BSC projects like pancakeswap. 
{% endhint %}

## Treasury Funds

10% of the initial supply will be placed in the treasury for the following purposes: 

●  Manual buyback and burns

●  Paying for audits, product features, and project expenses

●  Marketing and promotions

●  Future listings on major exchanges

●  NFT artist payments

●  New features

●  Seeding new liquidity pairs

{% hint style="info" %}
Deposit Fees will be assessed in BNB so as to not put sell pressure on the price of $ZMBE. Our team uses a multi-signature treasury wallet that requires majority consensus on the use of treasury funds.
{% endhint %}

We will publish a finalized treasury fund budget once it has been finalized. At launch, we are trying to be as flexible as possible to adapt to needs as they arise.

## Developer Vested Tokens

The dev team will be transparent about our tokens and lock funds in a time lock of 30 days. We also fully expect to participate just like all other token holders at launch with our own personal funds.

The Dev Team maintains 10% of initial supply \(a total of 10mil ZMBE\) in vested time-locked wallet which will unlock upon the following date: 



Our developer wallet is essentially a compensation plan for our core team of developers, artists, and more. This wallet also accrues a yield over time like other contracts.
