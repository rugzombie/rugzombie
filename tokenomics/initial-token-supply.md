# Initial Token Supply

## Liquidity Provision

80% of all our tokens will be time-locked in liquidity contract at fair launch. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Why not burned wallet address? As the transition of pancakeswap to version 2 displayed, our team wanted the ability to adjust to any issues that may arise. 
{% endhint %}

## Treasury Funds

10% of the initial supply will be placed in the treasury for the following purposes: 

●  Manual Buyback and Burns

●  Paying for audits, product features, and project expenses

●  Marketing and Promotions

●  Future listings on major exchanges

●  NFT artist payments

●  New features

●  Seeding new liquidity pairs

{% hint style="info" %}
Deposit Fees will be assessed in BNB so as to not put sell pressure on the price of $ZMBE. Our team uses a multi-signature treasury wallet that requires majority consensus on the use of treasury funds.
{% endhint %}

## Developer Vested Tokens

The dev team will be transparent about our tokens and lock funds in a series of time locks. We also fully expect to participate just like all other token holders at launch with our own personal funds.

The Dev Team maintains 10% of initial supply \(a total of 10mil ZMBE\) in vested time-locked wallets on the following schedule from our fair launch date:

1 month: 5%, or 500k ZMBE \(95% remaining\) 

3 months: 10% or 1mil ZMBE\(90% remaining\) 

6 months: 20% or 2mil ZMBE \(80% remaining\) 

12 months: 40% or 4mil ZMBE \(60% remaining\) 

18 months:80% or 8mil ZMBE \(20% remaining\)

24 months: all remaining tokens

As you can see, the time-locks for these funds extend well into the predicted "bear market" after 2021, and as such the selling incentive for developers will be less and less attractive as time goes on.
