# Initial Token Supply

## Liquidity Provision

80% of all our tokens will be in initial liquidity contract at fair launch. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Why not burned wallet address/locked LP? As the transition of pancakeswap to version 2 demonstrated  recently for many projects on PCS, burned/locked wallet addresses can really destroy a project. Our team wanted the ability to adjust to any issues that may arise over the course of time with new versioning of BSC projects like pancakeswap. We also plan to upgrade and release future versions of our project. Burned wallets remove the ability to do this. 
{% endhint %}

## Treasury Funds

10% of the initial supply will be placed in the treasury for the following purposes: 

●  Manual buyback and burns

●  Paying for audits, product features, subscriptions and project expenses

●  Marketing and promotions

●  Future listings on major exchanges

●  NFT artist payments, and contract developer payments

●  New features

●  Seeding new liquidity pairs

{% hint style="info" %}
Deposit Fees will be assessed in BNB so as to not put sell pressure on the price of $ZMBE. Our team uses a multi-signature treasury wallet that requires majority consensus on the use of treasury funds.
{% endhint %}

We will publish a finalized treasury fund budget once it has been finalized. At launch, we are trying to be as flexible as possible to adapt to needs as they arise. 

You can see the treasury fund wallet address here:

## Developer Vested Tokens

The dev team will be transparent about our tokens. We also fully expect to participate just like all other token holders at launch with our own personal funds.

The Dev Team maintains 10% of initial supply \(a total of 10mil ZMBE\) in vested wallet which is held in a multisignature wallet at this address:

 0x666a26C410BdfDB4B5D51B971E209Dda4A96594e

Our developer wallet is essentially a compensation plan for our core team of developers, artists, and more.
