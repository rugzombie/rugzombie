# Anti-Pump&Dump Launch Feature \(APD\)

RugZombie is a project born of passion. We are not whales, we are not major corporation. We are a group of passionate, thoughtful, well-meaning men and women who want to clean up the defi ecosystem and provide real value. 

So when we launched, we tried to do everything right. In lieu of doing an initial coin or flip offering, our team chose a fair public launch and to provide initial liquidity ourselves, locked from the start. 

Our hope is this move shows transparency and our team is invested long term because our own money went into it. 

As such, RugZombie is beginning with ultra low liquidity, and therefore requires careful stewardship right after launch to protect token holders from pump and dumps, sniper bots and whale manipulations. 

**Our APD feature prevents any token holder from buying or owning more than 2% of the total supply of $ZMBE at any one time.** 

Buy orders of 2% or more of the supply will be rejected and wallets holding 2% or more will not be able to acquire more $ZMBE through the swap feature until APD is lifted. They may still stake and earn $ZMBE through our LPs.

**Any holder of $ZMBE can still earn more through providing Liquidity and Staking in our smart contracts, as they have been whitelisted. Until the APD is lifted, THIS IS THE ONLY WAY to acquire more $ZMBE if you own more than 2% of the supply.**

Our team plans to monitor the initial release of our token and to scale this percentage back as necessary and to remove this APD feature completely once our public launch has stabilized. 

Our treasury wallet has been whitelisted and this feature will not apply on the wallet.
