# Additional Card Information

## Intelligence Quotient (Intelligence Cost)&#x20;

Each card comes with an associated IQ or card "intelligence cost". When building a deck of 20 or more cards, each player can build a deck with a maximum of 100 intelligence.&#x20;

&#x20;A card may only be placed into a deck if it does not cause the deck to exceed the intelligence limit.&#x20;

Leader Card and Ally Cards do not contribute to the overall Intelligence Cost.

## Leader Cards

There may only be one leader per deck. This card does not get shuffled into the 20 card deck but is instead set aside to be played first.&#x20;

## Rarity and Mint Numbers

ZOM cards are issued as NFTs on the BNB Chain. As such, they have characteristics of rarity and a unique identification number, or "mint number".

### &#x20;Card Rarity

Each card type is classified as

Common&#x20;

Uncommon&#x20;

Rare&#x20;

Legendary&#x20;

Mythic\*

Biblical\*

Special

These types have nothing to do with the gameplay of the card. **They generally describe the intelligence that will be required to add them to your deck, but this is not always the case.**

\*Mythic & Biblical Cards - There may only be 1 copy of these cards per deck.

An NFT deck building game like ZOM has a few unique features that factor into gameplay:

### Card Mint Numbers

Each card has been minted as an NFT and as such has a unique \[ID] number associated with it.&#x20;

These mint numbers only affect gameplay in a specific aspect. In rarity mode, lower mint numbers will offer slight advantages over the same card with higher mint numbers, thus a \[1] mint is better than a \[50] mint.

Card Mint Numbers affect the Ally Row and your related Ally Points.
