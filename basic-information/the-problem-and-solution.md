# The Problem and Solution

## The Problem

Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology and smart contract protocols such as Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain, anyone can create tokens and launch projects on the blockchain. While this decentralized space has led to the creation of many incredible projects within the DeFi economy, it has also opened the door to a proliferation of scams, fraud and dead-on-arrival projects exposing the public, “apes” and “degens” to financial risk.

An individual who has suffered a significant financial loss at the hands of a nefarious developer or “dev" is said to have been “rugged” or “rug pulled.” After a project has been “rugged” by the dev, the project’s tokens often have little to no residual value or utility.   


For the uninitiated, a “rugged project” is a scam wherein the dev removes value from a project through malicious written code in a token’s contract, removing token’s liquidity, selling off large amounts of a token’s supply and more. That said, not all dead projects are intentionally rugged, but the result is the same; little or no remaining value in the project’s token. Some rugged tokens were subject to an exploit from the outside, but for the purposes of this project, we will refer to both inside and outside exploitations as "rugs". 

As long as decentralized finance remains, there will likely be rugged projects, malicious developer activity, hacks, and dead coins due to general incompetence or lack of developer activity.

## Our Mission

While RugZombie cannot prevent the public from being exposed to or a victim of “rug pulls”, it is our mission to restore value to “rugged projects” and give victims of “rug pulls” a cathartic way to move on by creating new and innovative incentives that will redeem “rugged projects” and victims of “rug pulls.”

> Welcome to RugZombie, where the dead will rise again and join the living.

The RugZombie Team has created a Dapp from a fork of PancakeSwap code to allow users the opportunity to stake “dead” tokens in our [GRAVES](main-features/graves/) or [TOMBS](main-features/tombs.md) in exchange for custom NFT artwork as a consolation prize or perhaps earn a yield with our $ZMBE token.

For our “[GRAVES](main-features/graves/)”, the user will donate at least one dead or “rugged” token and stake a certain amount of $ZMBE for a set time-frame to unlock receive a one-of-a- kind NFT as a trophy for being “rugged.” The dead-weight in your trust wallet just got a bit lighter.

For our “[TOMBS](main-features/tombs.md)”, the user will need to donate a certain amount of dead or “rugged” tokens and a certain amount of $ZMBE \(for our buyback and burn program\) to unlock the Tomb. Once unlocked, the user will be able to stake their “rugged” tokens and $ZMBE in order to earn a $ZMBE yield, much like other yield farming contracts. $ZMBE isn’t falling from heaven but clawing its way out of a grave.

[GRAVES](main-features/graves/) are designed for “rugged” tokens that have zero or very little financial value while our [TOMBS](main-features/tombs.md) are designed for “rugged” tokens that retain some residual value by way of locked liquidity. This residual value allows our team to resurrect life from dead tokens by allowing our users to stake their rugged tokens in our [TOMBS](main-features/tombs.md) to receive a comparable yield with $ZMBE, thereby resurrecting the rugged token from the dead. It is quite possible for users who hold $ZMBE long enough to completely recover their lost value from these scammed projects. It’s alive!!!
