# The Problem and Solution

## The Problem

There are many issues concerning blockchain technologies. From prolific scams to lack of true use-cases, much of the activity regarding crypto assets is purely speculative; price discovery, clever marketing, and a lack of true vision for making something great.&#x20;

## Our Mission

RugZombie is doing 4 primary things on the crypto space, beginning on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC);

1. We identify and "bury" rug pulled tokens in our [GRAVES](main-features/graves/) for unique NFTs.&#x20;
2. We create NFT-powered gaming platforms. Starting with our minigame, [Patient Zero](../nft-+-gamefi-services/patient-o-zero.md), and with more in development, turn your NFTs into game assets.
3. We bridge the gap between digital and physical assets. With our unique merchandising apparatus and system, your NFTs will serve as a powerful digital item for the next generation of commerce. (more coming soon)
4. Under the surface, the Zombie team is committed to strengthening business to business services and forging unique and lasting partnerships that will connect the blockchain world together.
