# The Problem & Solution

## The Problem

There are many issues concerning blockchain technologies. From prolific scams to tokens that lack true use-cases, much of the activity regarding crypto assets has created a purely speculative bubble filled with "moon boys" and "degens" trying to earn money in an unregulated environment; this unhealthy activity has made true emerging user-centered platforms difficult to find.

## Our Mission

RugZombie is doing 4 primary things on the crypto space, beginning on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC);

1. Identify and Issue NFTs for Dead/Rugpulled Tokens as cathartic art.&#x20;
2. An NFT Powered Gaming Studio. Starting with our minigame, [Patient Zero](nft-marketplace-+-gamefi-services/dead-games-studio/patient-o-zero.md), and with more in development, turn your NFTs into game assets.
3. Bridge the gap between digital and physical assets (our upcoming merch portal will be mind-blowing)&#x20;
4. Under the surface, the Zombie team is committed to strengthening business to business relationships with our partners to encourage healthy development in crypto by productizing our technology and offering a range of quality services.
