# The Problem and Solution

## The Problem

Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology and smart contract protocols such as Ethereum, Polygon and the Binance Smart Chain, anyone can create tokens and launch projects on the blockchain. While this decentralized space has led to the creation of many incredible projects within the DeFi economy, it has also opened the door to a proliferation of scams, fraud and dead projects, exposing the public, “apes” and “degens” to financial risk.

An individual who has suffered a significant financial loss at the hands of a nefarious developer  is said to have been “rugged” or “rug pulled.” After a project has been “rugged” by the dev, the project’s tokens often have little to no residual value or utility. This "rug" can happen through bad developer activity, lackluster project development, failure to thrive or outside exploits.

RugZombie does not desire to provide the "final word" on what constitutes a rug-pull, and reserves the right to list GRAVES for tokens that fit the above criteria. Listing a GRAVE for said tokens does not constitute an official position on a token's active status (just take a look at our USD grave).

As long as decentralized finance remains, there will likely be rugged projects, malicious developer activity, hacks, and dead coins, and so our team will continue to add GRAVES as they come.

## Our Mission

While RugZombie cannot prevent the public from being exposed to or a victim of “rug pulls”, it is our mission to restore value to holders of rugged projects and give victims of rug pulls a cathartic way to move on by creating new and innovative incentives that will redeem rugged projects and victims of rug pulls.

> Welcome to RugZombie, where the dead will rise again and join the living.

The RugZombie Team has created a Dapp to allow users the opportunity to offer dead tokens in our [GRAVES](main-features/graves/) in exchange for custom NFT artwork as a consolation prize and earn a yield with our $ZMBE token.

After unlocking our “[GRAVES](main-features/graves/)”, the user will donate at least one dead or “rugged” token for verification (this token is unrecoverable) and stake a minimum amount of $ZMBE for a set time-frame to unlock and receive a one-of-a- kind NFT as a trophy for being rugged. The dead-weight in your trust wallet just got a bit lighter. Funds can be removed at any time, but there will be an early withdrawal fee to incentivize users to patiently farm their NFT. NFTs will be issued only after the set time-frame.

[GRAVES](main-features/graves/) are designed for rugged tokens that have zero or very little financial value while our [TOMBS](main-features/tombs.md) are designed to incentivize holding ZMBE-BNB LP on our various DEX listings.
