# The Problem and Solution

## The Problem

Due to the decentralized nature of blockchain technology and smart contract protocols such as Ethereum and the Binance Smart Chain, anyone can create tokens and launch projects on the blockchain. While this decentralized space has led to the creation of many incredible projects within the DeFi economy, it has also opened the door to a proliferation of scams, fraud and dead projects, exposing the public, “apes” and “degens” to financial risk.

An individual who has suffered a significant financial loss at the hands of a nefarious developer  is said to have been “rugged” or “rug pulled.” After a project has been “rugged” by the dev, the project’s tokens often have little to no residual value or utility. 

For the uninitiated, a rugged project can come in various forms, typically a scam wherein the dev removes money from a project through maliciously written code in a token’s contract, removing a token’s liquidity, or selling off large amounts of a token’s supply. That said, not all dead projects are intentionally rugged, but the result is the same; little or no remaining value in the project’s token. Some dead projects simply failed to catch investor interest. Some hacked tokens have been subject to an exploit from the outside, but for the purposes of this project, we will utilize all the above, whether hacks or  "rugs" due to the end result being the same.

As long as decentralized finance remains, there will likely be rugged projects, malicious developer activity, hacks, and dead coins.

## Our Mission

While RugZombie cannot prevent the public from being exposed to or a victim of “rug pulls”, it is our mission to restore value to holders of rugged projects and give victims of rug pulls a cathartic way to move on by creating new and innovative incentives that will redeem rugged projects and victims of rug pulls.

> Welcome to RugZombie, where the dead will rise again and join the living.

The RugZombie Team has created a Dapp from a fork of PancakeSwap code to allow users the opportunity to stake dead tokens in our [GRAVES](main-features/graves/) or [TOMBS](main-features/tombs.md) in exchange for custom NFT artwork as a consolation prize and earn a yield with our $ZMBE token.

After unlocking our “[GRAVES](main-features/graves/)”, the user will donate at least one dead or “rugged” token for verification \(this token is unrecoverable\) and stake any amount of $ZMBE for a set time-frame \(usually 30 days\) to unlock and receive a one-of-a- kind NFT as a trophy for being rugged. The dead-weight in your trust wallet just got a bit lighter. Funds can be removed at any time, but there will be an early withdrawal fee to incentivize users to patiently farm their NFT. NFTs will be issued only after the set time-frame.

Our “[TOMBS](main-features/tombs.md)” are a bit different; the user will need to deposit a certain amount of dead or rugged tokens and a certain amount of RugZombie's token to pair in a unique Liquidity Pairing. The user will be able to stake their rugged tokens and RugZombie pairing in order to earn an additional yield in RugZombie's native token, much like other yield farming contracts. RugZombie isn’t falling from heaven but clawing its way out of a grave.

[GRAVES](main-features/graves/) are designed for rugged tokens that have zero or very little financial value while our [TOMBS](main-features/tombs.md) are designed for rugged tokens that retain some residual value by way of locked liquidity. This residual value allows our team to resurrect life from dead tokens by allowing our users to stake their rugged tokens in our [TOMBS](main-features/tombs.md) to receive a comparable yield with $ZMBE, thereby resurrecting the rugged token from the dead. It is quite possible for users who hold $ZMBE long enough to completely recover their lost value from these scammed projects. It’s alive!!!

While we realize there are a lot of complex dynamics at play when one considers utilizing scammed tokens to redeem value, we need to be clear that RugZombie is taking the best of care to select projects that could be eligible for our [TOMBS](main-features/tombs.md). To be frank, most scammed tokens will not pass our selection process that is implemented to ensure scammers and hackers are not rewarded for their behavior.
