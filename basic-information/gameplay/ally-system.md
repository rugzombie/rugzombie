# Ally System

## Ally Drafting Row

The Ally Drafting Row consists of 5 Ally Cards. Each player chooses 1 (non leader) card for to be placed into the all row. The other 3 ally cards will be randomly generated from the RugZombie collection.

Turn the first 3 allies over before battle 1. These allies are available during the first battle.

During the second battle, turn over the 4th ally card pile to reveal the ally noble. If there is a 3rd battle, turn over the final ally card.

## Claiming an Ally

Whenever a card is played into the battlefield, add ally points according to its mint number (equivalent) to your alliance pool. This pool can be drawn upon on your turn to claim an ally.

Claiming an Ally can be done on a playerâ€™s turn in addition to playing card abilities or playing cards.&#x20;

The number of ally points needed to attempt any alliance is X.

When attempting an alliance, you will spend the required ally points, and be able to claim an ally to place into your hand.
