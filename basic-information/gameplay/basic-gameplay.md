# Basic Gameplay

## Beginning & Playing a Game

When beginning a game, first player is decided at random, and both players draws their hand of 8 cards. They may choose to return 1 card and exchange it for another as a [re-draw](../new-or-zom-a-trading-card-game/setting-up-the-game-and-game-board.md#redraws-and-mulligans).

Each battle is made up of alternating "turns" between the two players.&#x20;

A turn consists of;

Playing one card from your hand, claiming allies, using your leader ability or any other card abilities. Or passing.

While on the Battlefield, units add their Strength values to the player's total score. At the end of the battle, the player with the highest total score wins. If both players have the same score at the end of a battle, both players lose.

Strength is tracked per row, and then combined in a total number.

If a card's strength is reduced to zero, it is sent to the playerâ€™s discard pile and its strength is removed from the player's total. Units receive damage permanently.&#x20;

Remember that Locations do not add to the strength of your horde.&#x20;

A player may choose to pass at any point; doing so will forfeit playing any more cards for the turn and the remainder of the battle. The opposing player may choose to continue playing cards until they decide to pass or run out of cards.&#x20;

Running out of cards to play from your hand will result in a pass.

The player that wins two out of three battles wins the contest.
