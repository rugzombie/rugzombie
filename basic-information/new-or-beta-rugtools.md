## RugTools Messaging Service

Welcome to RugTools (Beta). RugZombie does not desire to deliver services ONLY post-mortem, after a rugpull or hack, but as we mutate, we are excited to offer a suite of services to keep users and projects safe as they interact in web3.

How can you use the service? \
\- Send VERIFIED messages on the chain

\-In emergencies, if your social accounts are hacked, you can send on-chain messages

\-Verify messages through the rugtools portal

### What is Safe Message w/ RugToolsBot?

Problem: While smart contracts can remain reasonably safe due to the security offered by the blockchain, as web3 projects use web2 tools such as discord, twitter, etc, authority accounts such as these are being hacked and users subsequently phished in social engineering attacks.&#x20;

Solution: Safe Message by RugTools! By leveraging on-chain messaging, RugTools allows NFT and token project owners on the BNBChain (more chains to come) to send secure messages that are publicly auditable on the blockchain .

Our telegram bot and discord bot are currently live. By registering with Safe Message, you can send messages on-chain that will publish to your telegram and can be found by visiting our [tools page](https://tools.rugzombie.io/messaging/admin).&#x20;

## Setting up your RugToolsBot

The setup process is meant to be simple, straightforward. How you choose to use and deploy the service is really up to you. Remember, discord and telegram are still web2 tools, but our key difference is that these messages are verifiable on the chain.&#x20;

## !!!Important!!! Announcing to Your Community

As you add these messenger wallets and the bot system to your community. It is important to share this information publicly with your community. We recommend the following:

1. In your white paper, publicly list your messenger wallet address, along with alias .
2. Copy this message on your gitbook or other white paper for users to verify the service:&#x20;

### Safe Messages

{% hint style="info" %}
Our Project Uses 'Safe Messaging' in order to secure our messages on the chain. Safe Messages use a bot service, but you can verify these messages on the blockchain or verify them with the following info:

1. Go to [https://tools.rugzombie.io/messaging](https://tools.rugzombie.io/messaging/admin)
2. Connect your wallet (needed to get the blockchain ID from)&#x20;
3. Use either the alias or wallet address search to pull up all the messages sent by the address
4. Messenger Address:&#x20;
5. Messenger Alias:&#x20;
{% endhint %}

We also recommend a public announcement of using the tool to your community so that they know what they are seeing.&#x20;

#### Service Costs

The RugToolsBot messaging service is intended to be a public utility and therefore as cheap as possible:

Sending on-chain messages requires a gas cost (minimal)&#x20;

To set up the bot and send messages requires a fractional charge or 2$ to setup and .50c per message. These costs support feeding the contract, deploying on new chains and maintaining the bots.&#x20;
