# Oblivion NFT Marketplace

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/Oblivion 2.1.jpg>)

Welcome to the Oblivion, a user-centric NFT marketplace on the RugZombie platform.&#x20;

Oblivion boasts a number of benefits for NFT lovers:

* optimized and fast user experience
* &#x20;the lowest service fees on BSC of secondary marketplaces (see below)
* NFT rental system for passive earnings on your NFT assets\*
* absolutely FREE minting services for select artists/projects (see more below)&#x20;
* dedicated project focused pages for your NFT collection

\*see a roadmap of Oblivion Marketplace Release below\*

## Optimized User Experience

The oblivion market is intended to be a quality NFT marketplace that boasts low fees and high quality optimized site design so that your NFT trading experience can be enjoyable. If you have feedback don't hesitate to let us know so we can improve the experience overall.&#x20;

## Service Fees

RugZombie's Oblivion Market is meant to provide the absolute lowest NFT service fees on the chain. While other projects can charge up to 5%, RugZombie's max service is 1% for all transactions and can go as low as .25%.

The service fees has 2 simple tiers:&#x20;

* If BNB is used to buy/sell NFTs, the user is rebated 50% of the service fee in $ZMBE.&#x20;
* If the seller holds either the Whale Pass Season 1 in their wallet, they can reduce the service fee even further by 50% more.

This means that if both of these conditions are met, users can enjoy a service fee of .25% on NFT sales.&#x20;



## Rental Market (coming soon)



RugZombie's ecosystem involves a variety of released features and games in development that utilize our NFT collection. For this reason, the Oblivion Market will soon have a rental feature that allows NFT holders to rent their NFTs to other users for passive income.&#x20;

\*Are you an NFT project or game-fi project that wants to incorporate rentals into your system? Send us a message; we would love to help you receive royalties from our rental system and provide a way for your project to benefit substantial from our rental system.&#x20;



## Free Minting Service

For selected projects and artists, the RugZombie Oblivion Market will not charge project owners and artist to mint NFTs on their page.&#x20;

#### For Artists

In exchange for this benefit, premier artists are expected to help produce some of the RugZombie NFT collection.&#x20;

This whitelisted premier status is only available for select artists and projects.&#x20;

If you are interested in receiving this premier service on the Oblivion Market, send an email to info@rugzombie.io with the title: MINTING SERVICE.

Whitelisted artists will enjoy publicity and budget-free marketing from our team as a support at no cost.&#x20;

#### For Project Owners / Collections

For project owners who have NFT collections, RugZombie team would love to get your project whitelisted for secondary trading with royalties and a dedicated profile page for your project. [Please let us know here](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/4/d/e/1FAIpQLSdkKJRBugKWdVOryendbJVfLoNX7VB8UKNjH0g6xavDafUKRA/viewform?usp=send\_form).

Whitelisted NFT collections are eligible to become in game NFT assets for our [patient zero minigame](../../../nft-+-gamefi-services/patient-o-zero.md), and more.

These NFT collections will enjoy publicity and budget-free marketing  from our team as a support at no cost.&#x20;

## Roadmap to Oblivion

_Put your heart in a blender, and watch it spin around._



The Oblivion NFT Marketplace will not be released in one stage, but multiple stages.&#x20;

1\) Whitelisting RugZombie NFTs only for buying, trading, selling. We will deprecate our Mausoleum so that future auctions will be hosted on the marketplace.&#x20;

2\) Whitelisting premier artists and selected projects for dedicated secondary pages.&#x20;

3\) Open season where NFTs may be listed from any collection from any user (without dedicated support). Projects that desire a dedicated page must go through our [whitelisting process](whitelisting-process.md).

4\) Self-minting services for all users (for a nominal fee)
