# Catacombs

The Humans Live down here!

The catacombs offers humans (or peaceful zombies?) many opportunities. They have developed quite the ecosystem down there. Here are just a few offerings, not particularly in order. Please see our Medium Posts and subscribe to socials to get a good idea of feature release dates.

**Rug Roll- Released quickly after Launch**

Simply deposit a rugged token which has a GRAVE listed in our graves page, and burn 1$ worth of ZMBE. For doing so, you will receive another whitelisted rug token. This mechanism is irrespective of price. You can see the odds of receiving certain rugged token on the page itself based on what is in the contract at the time. This allows our users to eliminate the need to purchase rugged tokens from the open market and avoid interacting with any suspect websites. We have future versioning of this feature to keep increasing safety of our users.

**The Barracks**

Barracks is our user-controlled NFT only pool collection. The set of NFTs in the barracks are available for locking up assets for a set amount of time. The pools have a maximum stake so that there is a maximum number of mints available.&#x20;

**Data Lab — Released on Launch**

Our Data Lab is where the Humans collect their information on the happenings above the surface. The engineers try to filter through the noise, radio and satellite signals to detect any communication, not to mention any human intelligence gathering units they may have above…

Our Data Lab features our MYTHIC tier NFTs and our newest category of rarity: SPECIAL NFTs among other things. As paying off the right people can result in leaks from the lab, these NFTs are available for insta-purchase.

There are future plans in store for the lab, but for now, enjoy some instant gratification. You will see a variety of options: limited edition supply (MYTHIC) NFTs, SPECIAL NFTs, and even rising price floors on certain pieces of our collection.

The First Leak from the Lab is the MYTHIC CATACOMBS NFT, the very first discovered and confirmed intelligence report intercepted by the under dwellers.

More information will be released on future versioning in due time.

**The Dungeon**

Our [Patient Zero](../../nft-+-gamefi-services/patient-o-zero.md) game is hosted down here. See the page for more.
