## G-FI \(Our First Spawning Pool\)

GFI Spawning pool address: 0x83818859688eF175F6AEAFb80Be881Db24A4E50a 

\*please note the GFI token is a reflect token, as such the original supply will accrue additional GFI rewards over-time. Any remaining GFI will remain in the Treasury Wallet or remitted back to the Gorilla-Fi team. 

We have calculated the reflection tax into the UI for the harvest function and the amount displayed should be the amount you will receive after the tax has been implemented.
