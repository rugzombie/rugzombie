# Tombs (NFTombs)

Our tombs are most similar to what users experience with LP Farms. Our TOMBS provide various opportunities for our users to earn additional ZMBE rewards for providing Liquidity on ZMBE-BNB Pair on the various DEX partners. 



## Non Fungible Randomness

Our TOMBS not only provide some of the best yields our platform has to offer in ZMBE rewards, but additionally provide a unique way for users to randomly generate NFTs based on their share of the Liquidity Pool. 

RugZombie has integrated [ChainLink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/) to fairly and randomly distribute NFTs to LP holders in our Tombs based on their share of the pool. Simply put: the more LP you provide, the higher your chances to roll a RARE or LEGENDARY NFT. 

Our NFTs for all TOMBS are the same for our common, uncommon and rare NFTs, but our Legendary NFTs are created specifically for each Pair. 

Currently, we are listed on 3 DEX, therefore have a total of 3 LEGENDARY NFT, corresponding to their pools: 

Autoshark Pairing: Legendary Ocean 

ApeSwap Pairing: Inevitable Ape

PancakeSwap Pairing: ???

All our Tombs will also eventually have corresponding Graves so that users may both acquire custom NFTs and earn a yield on their scammed tokens.

We hope to add future LP pairs on various DEX tokens in the future, please stay tuned for more as we add partnerships.

There is a deposit fee (in BNB) for tombs to be unlocked. This deposit fee allows our team to:

* Buy back and burn ZMBE
* Pay our starving artists
* Build up our treasury fund for future liquidity pools, audits etc. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Our Deposit Fee is assessed in BNB to reduce selling pressure of ZMBE to keep our token price stable. TLDR: Our team is discussing development of our own AMM in order to sustain the project long-term and move away from deposit fees in general.
