# Tombs (NFTombs)

Our tombs are most similar to what users experience with LP Farms.&#x20;

Our TOMBS provide various opportunities for our users to earn additional ZMBE rewards for providing Liquidity on ZMBE-BNB Pair on the various DEX partners.&#x20;



## Non Fungible Randomness

Our TOMBS not only provide some of the best yields our platform has to offer in ZMBE rewards, but additionally provide a unique way for users to randomly generate NFTs based on their share of the Liquidity Pool.&#x20;

RugZombie has integrated [ChainLink VRF](https://docs.chain.link/docs/chainlink-vrf/) to fairly and randomly distribute NFTs to LP holders in our Tombs based on their share of the pool. Simply put: the more LP you provide, the higher your chances to roll a RARE or LEGENDARY NFT.&#x20;

Our NFTs for all TOMBS are the same for our common, uncommon and rare NFTs, but our Legendary NFTs are created specifically for each Pair.&#x20;

Currently, we are listed on 3 DEX, therefore have a total of 3 LEGENDARY NFT, corresponding to their pools:&#x20;

Autoshark Pairing: Legendary Ocean&#x20;

ApeSwap Pairing: Inevitable Ape

PancakeSwap Pairing: Cake Zombie
