**So What Happens with the Winning Bid? **

Glad you asked. Most of our auctions are meant to fund specific development or marketing efforts, however some of these will be charity auctions (stay tuned to our socials for this).

In general auction funds are used as follows:

50% goes to the artist

25% goes to our treasury

25% goes to burn ZMBE

Stay tuned to our socials for our upcoming 1/1 Auctions (Biblical Rarity NFTs)
