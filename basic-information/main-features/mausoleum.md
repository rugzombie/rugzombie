# Mausoleum

As RugZombie team is continuing to build our ecosystem of gaming, entertainment and merchandising, our Mausoleum will function as an auction feature that allows our users to secure incredibly rare and valuable NFTs. 

Some of the NFTs are centered around some marketing campaigns and are simply fun, while others are purposefully created as a line of exclusive Zombie cards that may or may not have value in our gaming and other features. \(They most certainly will if you didn't get the hint\). 

The Mausoleum works as follows: 

1. Users purchase a ticket for the Mausoleum \(50% of this fee goes to burning the ZMBE supply and the other goes to the treasury for continued development\) 
2. Users bid in our dynamic auction function with ZMBE-BNB LP. This is quite unique as most other auctions take single assets rather than LP pairs. 
3. The highest bidder at the close of auction will win the NFT. 

**So What Happens with the Winning Bid?** 

Glad you asked. Most of our auctions are meant to fund specific development or marketing efforts, however some of these will be charity auctions \(stay tuned to our socials for this\).

25% of the winning bid goes directly back to our Liquidity Wallet, thereby raising the floor of the total liquidity available. 

The rest will be unpaired, the ZMBE will be burned, thereby decreasing the supply and the BNB will be returned to the treasury for its specific intended purpose \(marketing, charity or development\).

Our First Series, "Patient Zero" is a marketing auction that will increase funds for our marketing funds for continued exposure to the BSC market.
