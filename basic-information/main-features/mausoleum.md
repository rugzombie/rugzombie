# Mausoleum

Occasionally, the RugZombie team releases 1/1 NFTs for the community to bid on. These NFTs have powerful in-game effects, and acquiring them early on for cheaper price points is recommended.

**So What Happens with the Winning Bid?**&#x20;

Glad you asked. Most of our auctions are meant to fund specific development or marketing efforts, however some of these will be charity auctions (stay tuned to our socials for this).

In general auction funds are used as follows:

50% goes to the artist

25% goes to our treasury

25% goes to burn ZMBE

Stay tuned to our socials for our upcoming 1/1 Auctions (Biblical Rarity NFTs)
