# NFTs

It sucks to be the victim or a rug pull. While you may never recover the lost value of certain tokens, we remain committed to helping you get value in a novel way: custom NFTs. 

Our [GRAVES](graves/) allow users to earn custom NFT artwork that will be a consolation prize of sorts for being scammed. 

Our NFTs will serve many functions. Not only do we aim to provide quality awesome looking NFTs, but they will play a key role in our upcoming [gaming ecosystem](./). 

Additionally, once our secondary market is created, users will be able to trade their trophy NFTs with others. NFT artwork is exclusive to each particular rugged token project, and will therefore be more difficult to acquire for those who were not scammed, making them fairly unique. 

If you have suggestions for artists for our NFT collection we would be happy to hear. [Let us know here](../../feedback-suggestions-and-bug-bounty.md) or in our [telegram](../../other-links/socials.md) group.
