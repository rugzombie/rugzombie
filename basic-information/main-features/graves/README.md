# Graves

Graves are single asset staking pools wherein the user stakes:

* An "unlock amount" of $ZMBE to unlock the grave
* At least 1 of the rugged/scammed token 

The user will be rewarded for staking $ZMBE and the rugged token for a certain amount of time \(determined by each pool\) with a single NFT commemorating their rugged token experience and a determined amount of $ZMBE relative to the amount of $ZMBE staked.

There is a deposit fee \(in BNB\) for graves to be unlocked. This deposit fee allows our team to:

* Buy back and burn ZMBE
* Pay our starving artists
* Build up our treasury fund for future liquidity pools, audits etc.

These NFTs may be a fun way to adjust to losing money on scammed tokens, but will have utility in our upcoming NFT gaming ecosystem and value on our secondary market as well. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Our Deposit Fee is assessed in BNB to reduce selling pressure of ZMBE to keep our token price stable. TLDR: You won't see our treasury wallet selling lots of $ZMBE.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
We determine the APR for $ZMBE staking based on the amount of $ZMBE only. Your rugged token is ONLY used to determine eligibility for the NFT.
