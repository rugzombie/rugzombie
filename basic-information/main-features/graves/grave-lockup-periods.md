# Grave Timer Periods

**Grave and Tomb Timers**&#x20;

In order to earn our custom NFTs, users must stake their funds for a specific amount of time, denoted in each Grave.

You will see two timers, one which denotes how long until your NFT is done minting, and the other is the countdown of the withdrawal fee.

Deposited tokens can be withdrawn at any time, but if you choose to withdraw your initial deposit before the allotted time has passed, a withdraw fee will be assessed. Please be careful and thoughtful about when to deposit and withdraw funds.&#x20;

Please read the conditions of each pool before you begin staking or providing liquidity.&#x20;
