# Grave Lockup Periods

**Grave Lockup Time Periods**

$ZMBE employs a unique feature that penalizes early withdrawal from all our graves, tombs and spawning pools. As all our graves, tombs and spawning pools require a certain vested time period to earn the NFT rewards, or farming rewards, the withdrawal fee helps ensure $ZMBE stays in staking pools and punishes arbitrage bots for harvesting and dumping too frequently. 

To clarify, the withdrawal fee does not locks users' deposits. Deposited tokens can be withdrawn at any time, but if you choose to withdraw your farming rewards or initial deposit before the allotted time has passed, a withdraw fee will be assessed. Please be careful and thoughtful about when to deposit and withdraw funds. 

We have also created a fun way to encourage users to stake more $ZMBE for longer. Simply put: in some graves, the MORE $ZMBE and rugged tokens you stake, the faster you receive your NFT. This will not be the case for every grave and tomb, please read the conditions of each pool before you begin staking or providing liquidity.
