# Grave Lockup Periods

**Grave Lockup Time Periods**

$ZMBE employs a unique feature that penalizes early withdrawal from all our graves, tombs and crypts. As all our graves, tombs and crypts require a certain vested time period to earn the NFT rewards, or farming rewards, the withdrawal fee helps ensure $ZMBE stays in staking pools and punishes arbitrage bots for harvesting and dumping. 

To clarify, the withdrawal fee does not locks users' deposits. Deposited tokens can be withdrawn at any time, but if you choose to withdraw your farming rewards before the allotted time has passed, a withdraw fee will be assessed. 

We have also created a fun way to encourage users to stake more $ZMBE for longer. Simply put: in some graves, the MORE $ZMBE you stake, the faster you receive your NFT. This will not be the case for every grave and tomb, please read the conditions of each pool before you begin staking or providing liquidity.
