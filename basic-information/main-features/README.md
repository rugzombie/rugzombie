# Main Features

1. **NFT:** Custom and unique NFTs for rug pulled tokens in our [GRAVES](graves/) (they are only available to those who have been a victim of that rug)&#x20;
2. **Liquidity & Farming**: Liquidity pairings with ZMBE-BNB in our [TOMBS](tombs.md) for exclusive, vrf randomized NFT rewards. The more you stake, the better your odds of rare NFTs.
3. **Gaming/Entertainment Ecosystem**: A custom NFT based game (In Development; see [roadmap](../roadmap.md)) among other unique NFT based projects (these are super secret for now)
4. ****[**Secondary Market**](../nft-+-gamefi-services/oblivion-nft-marketplace/): A peer to peer marketplace to buy, sell and trade your rugged $ZMBE NFTs and Merch.
5. **Community Building Features**: Auctions, Secret Dapp Sections, Special Events, and other fun ways to earn $ZMBE and Collectible NFTs.&#x20;

As you can see, our main features have nothing to do with tokenomics (which you can see next), because **utility is the underlying value of our blockchain project.**&#x20;
