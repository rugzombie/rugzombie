# Main Features

1. **NFT Farming:** Stake in our graves, tombs and spawning pools to earn NFTs.
2. **Liquidity & Yield Farming**: Liquidity pairings with ZMBE-BNB in our [TOMBS](tombs.md) for exclusive, vrf randomized NFT rewards. The more you stake, the better your odds of rare NFTs. All our grave also emit a nominal amount of ZMBE.
3. **Games:** Our partner and  "ecosystem" project, Dead Games, will be releasing games based on the RugZombie NFT collection and token.  We are proud to have this game studio delivering high quality content for the RugZombie project.
4. ****[**Secondary Market**](../nft-marketplace-+-gamefi-services/oblivion-nft-marketplace/): The Oblivion NFT Marketplace, another partner and ecosystem project boasts of a peer to peer marketplace to buy, sell, trade and rent your rugged $ZMBE NFTs and other favorite NFT collections. We are glad to work with them in our RugZombie network of partners.
5. **Community Building Features**: Auctions, Secret Dapp Sections, Special Events, and other fun ways to earn $ZMBE and Collectible NFTs.&#x20;

As you can see, our main features have nothing to do with tokenomics (which you can see next), because **utility and development is the underlying value of our blockchain project.**&#x20;
