# Main Features

1. **NFT:** Custom and unique NFTs for Rug Pulled Tokens in our [GRAVES](graves/) \(they are only available to those who have been victim of that rug\) 
2. **Liquidity & Farming**: Unique Liquidity Pairings with Rug Pulled Projects in our [TOMBS](tombs.md) for anyone willing to experiment, and earn a $ZMBE yield
3. **Gaming Ecosystem**: A custom NFT Trading Card Game \(In Development; see [roadmap](../roadmap.md)\)
4. **Secondary Market**: A peer to peer marketplace to buy, sell and trade your Rugged ZMBE NFTs.
5. **Community Features**: Auctions, Special Events, and other fun ways to earn ZMBE and Collectible NFTs. Our team is excited to move to a place of on chain governance and giving the community the "keys to the grave". 

The community features will not happen immediately, but after a long period of thought and consideration for the best decisions for the project. Decentralization is the goal, but we felt passionate about getting things right before unlocking community features such as voting and governance on emission rates, future graves and partnerships etc. 

As you can see, our main features have nothing to do with tokenomics \(which you can see next\), because **utility is the underlying value of any blockchain project.**
