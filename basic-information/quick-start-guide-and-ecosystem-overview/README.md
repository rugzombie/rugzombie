#### RugZombie Pool Details

All pools (spawning pools, graves, and tombs) will require a few interactions with your wallet. Users must:\


1. approve wallet interaction
2. burn a "rug" token (on graves only)&#x20;
3. pay "unlock grave" fee (on spawning pools and graves only)
4. deposit a minimum amount of ZMBE (determined by the pool)&#x20;

These details are described on our webpage, and also in the staking guide above. Please note that individual details are always listed on the pools themselves. It is in your best interest to carefully review them.
