## Optimized User Experience

The oblivion market is intended to be a quality NFT marketplace that boasts low fees and high quality optimized site design so that your NFT trading experience can be enjoyable. If you have feedback don't hesitate to let us know so we can improve the experience overall.&#x20;

## Service Fees

The Oblivion Market is meant to provide the absolute lowest NFT service fees on the chain. While other projects can charge up to 5%, Oblivion's max service is 1% for all transactions and can go as low as .25%. In partnership and coordination with RugZombie, Oblivion is set to disrupt the NFT marketplace world.

The service fees has 2 simple tiers:&#x20;

* If BNB is used to buy/sell NFTs, the user is rebated 50% of the service fee in $ZMBE.&#x20;
* If the seller holds the RugZombie Whale Pass Season 1 in their wallet, they can reduce the service fee even further by a 50% rebate and more.

This means that if both of these conditions are met, users can enjoy a service fee of .25% on NFT sales.&#x20;



## Rental Market (coming soon)



RugZombie's partner ecosystem involves a variety of released features and games in development from Dead Games that utilize our NFT collection. For this reason, the Oblivion Market will soon have a rental feature that allows NFT holders to rent their NFTs to other users for passive income.&#x20;
