# Whitelisting Process

We would be glad to list your NFT collection; we assess the following to begin whitelisting NFT collections:&#x20;

* Is it a previous partner project, owner or artist?&#x20;
* Is the quality of the NFTs/Project high?&#x20;
* Uses an accepted NFT standard?
* Has a dedicated following/user base?
* Smart Contracts are secure?
* Has a desire for long term relationship with the Oblivion Market?
* **We highly prioritize NFTs that can be used as in-game assets (such as** [**quest as a service**](../dead-games-studio/quest-as-a-service-qaas.md)**)**
