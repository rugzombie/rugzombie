# üè™ NFT Marketplace + GameFi Services

RugZombie is proud to announce the integration and partnership of Dead Games Studio, a web3 Game Studio designed to serve projects in blockchain.&#x20;

While Dead Games owns a number of assets utilized in the RugZombie ecosystem (the oblivion marketplace, the IP rights for our upcoming and existing games, art, etc.), RugZombie benefits enormously through this partnership in exclusive partnerships, free development consulting, control over some elements and some direction of the game and a wide range of other perks that long term will benefit the RugZombie world!

Because RugZombie was fair and publicly launched and is decentralized, we cannot claim that Dead Games owns RugZombie, but we can say that the Dead Games team serves the RugZombie mission.
