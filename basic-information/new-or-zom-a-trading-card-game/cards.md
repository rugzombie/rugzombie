# Cards

Now that you understand how to set up a game, and prepare for a battle, here is a comprehensive explanation of the card types, abilities and features:&#x20;

## Card Types

Cards are broken into various "types". There are 3 main types of cards with sub-categories for each:&#x20;

### Attacker

**Attackers come with a unit strength that determines their health and strength at the end of the round. Damage dealt to an attacker is permanent.**&#x20;

Attackers, as all cards, have an "intelligence" cost that become important in deck building. They will also sometimes have various limitations and/or abilities that determine the row they can be played, and any special abilities or limitations to affect gameplay.

### Location

**Locations have a defense strength. This strength is not added to the attack pool to win the battle, rather it is the amount of damage needed to destroy it and send it to the discard pile(the pit).**

Location cards DO NOT add to the total attack strength for winning the battle, but they offer various in game advantages that are extremely powerful.

### Chem

**Chem cards resolve instantly, placed into the discard pile and their effects last according to the card.**

## Card Abilities

#### General Card Ability Details

**Spawn Abilities** - Many cards have abilities that resolve upon play. These are called Spawn Abilities.&#x20;

**Command Abilities** - Some cards have choice abilities. A player may choose to use that ability on their turn. Some choice abilities have conditions or cooldowns.&#x20;

**Banish Abilities** - Some cards have banish abilities. You may sacrifice the card to accomplish its Banish ability.&#x20;

**Row Abilities** - Some cards have abilities/limitations that are triggered dependent on the row into which they are played&#x20;

**From the Grave Abilities** - Some cards (most likely of the zombie mold) will have abilities that will activate on death.

**Capital Abilities -** Location cards have abilities that can be accessed based on being in the capital slot.

**Ally Abilities -** Some cards have abilities that can be accessed if they come from the Ally Row.

**Mold & Horde Abilities** - Some cards have abilities triggered dependent on their horde or mold.&#x20;

## Hordes & Mold Types

#### Molds

All cards belong to a mold. The basic mold is Zombie.&#x20;

You can think of molds are general races of beings. The great Zom himself has created creatures in his own mold. Other molds may arise in the game in due time, taking the pattern of their creators.

#### Hordes, Tribes, Factions

All cards either belong to a Horde or they are neutral. If the card does not specify its Horde, it is neutral.

Hordes are the zombie way of describing a faction or tribe. Some abilities and card types require certain factions to be played/activated.
