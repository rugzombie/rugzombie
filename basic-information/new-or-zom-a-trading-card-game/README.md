### Introduction

Welcome to ZOM, a trading card game brought to you by RugZombie & Dead Games.&#x20;

As we prepare for our public BETA launch in \[REDACTED], we invite you to stick around and earn as many RugZombie NFTs as you can.&#x20;

Not much information is being shared about the game rules currently, but sometime in September we will release more information related to the game, rules, beta access and more.&#x20;

If you are a fan of the following games, you will likely enjoy our card game:&#x20;

* Magic the Gathering
* Hearthstone
* Gwent
* Splinterlands
* God's Unchained

We are truly overjoyed to bring this colossal development to the RugZombie ecosystem.&#x20;
