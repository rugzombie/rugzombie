# Setting up the Game & Game Board

The playing area consists of the game board itself,  and includes your hand of cards, the draw pile and the discard pile (the pit).

## The Game Board

The game board has 5 rows upon which cards can be played. These rows are:&#x20;

* Your Opponents Ranged Attack Row
* Your Opponents Melee Attack Row
* An Ally Row
* Your Melee Row
* Your Ranged Attack Row

You may play cards on your rows according to each card conditions. There may be cards that are allowed to be played across an opponents board.&#x20;

The Ally Row is a unique row of cards that can be drafted into your hand or into play under your control depending on certain game conditions.

## Setting Up The Game

To set up the game, players are required to have a deck of at least 20 cards plus 1 leader card and an Ally Card. If a player has a leader card, that card is placed on the leader slot. Each player then draws a hand of 8 cards.

Each game will also have an Ally Deck that can be drawn upon to support your Horde. Ally Deck Setup is described below and consists of randomized cards from the RugZombie collection.

### Drawing Cards

Each player draws cards before each battle. Before the first battle, each player draws a total of 8 cards.&#x20;

Before the second battle, each player may draw another 2 cards.&#x20;

Before the third and final battle, each player may draw another 2 cards.&#x20;

### Redraws and Mulligans

Each player is allowed to return 1 card from their hand and redraw another card before each battle in a contest. These re-draws accumulate and can be saved to be used before battle 2 or 3.

Before the second battle, both players draw 2 more cards from their draw deck. The maximum hand size is 8 cards. If a player is to draw a card but already has a full hand, they may instead return a card to the deck and draw another.

Before the third battle, both players draw 2 more cards. The maximum hand size is 8 cards. If a player is to draw a card but already has a full hand, they may instead return a card to the deck and draw another.

Once both players have chosen to redraw (or not) the battle can begin.

### Setting Up the Ally Row

The Ally Row is a unique row of cards that are available for players to draft into their hands based upon certain conditions. &#x20;

The ally row contains 3 randomized cards from the RugZombie collection and a card chosen by each player. These cards are shuffled and three of them are placed into the Ally Row upon the first battle.&#x20;

After each battle and before the next battle, reveal and replace one of the remaining ally cards in the ally row.&#x20;

Ally Cards can be claimed according to certain conditions during the game, which will be explained in another section.
