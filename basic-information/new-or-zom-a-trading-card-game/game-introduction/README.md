### Type of Game

ZOM is a collectible trading card game:&#x20;

* Collectible - Our cards exist as NFTs on the blockchain. You can collect as many as you would like
* Trading - Our cards can be traded to other players, bought and sold on our marketplace ([oblivion.art](../../nft-marketplace-+-gamefi-services/oblivion-nft-marketplace/)) and sold privately over the counter. You control and own your assets as NFTs, ZOM and RugZombie do not have any control over what NFTs you choose to hold.
* Card - Our NFTs are unique. We work with real artists, and get truly community driven artwork. As such, the "style" of our card artwork is unique, eclectic and may not be completely consistent. While our NFTs exist as the artwork which you can see [here](https://rugzombie.io/graveyard), in game, the NFTs are displayed on cards within the game. Outside the game, they will display as the art image only.
* Game - Obviously, this is a game. It involves risk, strategy, mystery, story and skill.&#x20;

#### Game Genre

There are many card games that exist in the physical and digital space. Our team loves all sorts of games, and you may see elements that remind you of other card games, but our gameplay style is unique and we have put a lot of thought and effort into the design of our specific game. Other card games in our genre are:&#x20;

* Magic the Gathering Online
* Hearthstone
* Star Realms
* Gwent
* Splinterlands
* Gods Unchained
* Dominion

This game is NOT a first person shooter, it isn't an RPG, it is a trading card game!&#x20;

#### Game Overview

Playing ZOM is simple and intuitive. Each contest is played in a best of 3 matches (battles). The winner of 2/3 battles wins the contest. In the case of a tie, both players lose.

Battles are played on a turn by turn basis. Each player will take turns playing 1 card from their hand, enabling any abilities on these cards before ending their turn. When a player does not want to play any more cards or has no more cards to play, he may end his turn and wait for the opposing player to wait as well. This will determine the winner of the first battle and move the players on toward the second battle.

A winner of each battle is decided by totaling each playerâ€™s attack strength, based on the strength of their played cards. This number is aggregated across all the cards on the board that a player controls.

The player who wins current battles plays first in the next one.&#x20;
