# Deck Building 101

## Beta, Tutorial and Sandbox Mode

When playing our Beta Versions, Tutorials, and Sandbox modes, you will not be required to form a deck of any size.&#x20;

In our tutorial mode and beta release, the cards will be provided to you free of charge to learn and understand the game.

#### Sandbox Mode

Sandbox mode is intended to be composable with no limitations, allowing players a chance to understand "what if" scenarios, and as such, all cards will be provided to you as a part of the Sandbox Mode experience.

## Building Your Deck&#x20;

Unless playing on the tutorial or sandbox mode, all gameplay modes require players to hold NFT cards in order to construct their deck of 20 cards.

Players are allowed to build any deck configuration they deem appropriate for their strategy within these limits:

#### Global Deck Parameters&#x20;

Decks must have:

* &#x20;20 cards minimum
* 1 leader card&#x20;
* 1 ally card
* Decks intelligence cost may not exceed 100 intelligence.

A deck may only have 1 leader card and 1 ally card.

**Mythic & Biblical Cards** - There may only be 1 copy of these cards per deck.

#### Card Parameters Intelligence&#x20;

Each card requires a certain amount of intelligence to put into a deck. A card may only be placed into a deck if it does not cause the deck to exceed the intelligence limit.&#x20;

## Brain NFT, Intelligence and Deck Building

Our team has not yet released our Brain NFT. The Brain NFT is earn-able through our referral mechanism that is yet to be implemented.&#x20;

When this referral feature is released, the Brain NFT will offer a dynamic solution to increase and decrease intelligence points while deck building, allowing for more and stronger cards in a deck.
