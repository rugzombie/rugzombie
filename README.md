# Introduction to RugZombie \($ZMBE\)

> Note: RugZombie is a new project, these documents are living and subject to change. Please stay active and be informed on our [social channels](other-links/socials.md).

Welcome to RugZombie \($ZMBE\), the first resurrected-value focused crypto on the Binance Smart Chain. 

While $ZMBE cannot prevent or predict the exposure of the public to “rug pulled” or “scammed” tokens, it is our mission to provide a value for the victims of rug pulled projects in a cathartic way, while offering actual utility on the Binance Smart Chain. 

Unfortunately, many users of crypto on BSC subject themselves to projects that focus exclusively on tokenomics in what can only be called a sophisticated ponzi scheme, which often result in rug pulls. 

Other tokens lose value as their initial dev team gives up due to lackluster price action and still others are exploited by flash loan attacks, and succumb to other smart contract risks.  

**As an overview, Rug Zombie exists to:**

* Create value out of dead or rugged tokens
* Provide a humorous way for crypto users to “move on” emotionally from their losses
* Promote a cleaner and safer defi ecosystem

Feel free to peruse our docs for any information.
