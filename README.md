# Introduction to RugZombie ($ZMBE)

Welcome to RugZombie ($ZMBE), the first resurrected-value focused crypto on the Binance Smart Chain.&#x20;

While $ZMBE cannot prevent or predict the exposure of the public to “rug pulled” or “scammed” tokens, it is our mission to provide a value for the victims of rug pulled projects in a cathartic way.

Unfortunately, many defi users subject themselves to rug pulls, scams, dead tokens, and hacks unknowingly.&#x20;

**As an overview, Rug Zombie exists to:**

* Create value out of dead or rugged tokens
* Provide a humorous way for crypto users to “move on” emotionally from their losses
* Promote a cleaner and safer defi ecosystem
