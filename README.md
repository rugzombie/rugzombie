Welcome to RugZombie ($ZMBE), the place where you come to bury the dead and earn sweet, brainy Zombie NFTs.

It is our mission to provide a value for the victims of rug pulled projects in a cathartic way and allow our community to have fun using NFTs in our featured games!

**As an overview, Rug Zombie exists to:**

* Create value (through NFTs) out of dead or rugged tokens
* Provide a humorous way for crypto users to “move on” emotionally from their losses
* Promote a cleaner and safer defi ecosystem

Feel free to explore our docs for any information.
