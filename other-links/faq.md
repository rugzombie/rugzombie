## How does the team select rugged tokens?

It is gravely serious situation when a project is “rugged” or deemed a scam. \(See what we did with that pun?\)

Our team has a process to determine what projects we will list in our graves and tombs. Some tokens are clearly a rugged/scammed project, some are dead due to developer inactivity or exploits from hackers.

Our team will consult a variety of elements to know what projects to list as we know the act of declaring a token dead is a quite a serious statement. A few considerations our team has:

●  How long has the project been deemed “dead” \(this is an effort to avoid malicious attempts to rug tokens on purpose in order to rob our tombs of liquidity\);

●  GitHub activity and existence of rug-features such as migration codes, minting features, etc.;

●  Price action of the token, volume, liquidity, and on-chain information \(Some price action is quite normal, and we will work diligently to discern whether people are simple FUDding projects that are very much alive\); and

●  Community engagement and requests \(Eventually token holders will be able to vote to pronounce projects dead. We will call these funeral services, kinda morbid we know.\)

## Why Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\)?

Scammed projects are prolific in DeFi, regardless of the blockchain, as long as decentralization is around, there will be opportunists who want to act in bad faith. While ERC-20 tokens and DeFi on the Ethereum network are prevalent, we believe the barrier of high gas fees and greater costs to run a project on the Ethereum network means that BSC is actually a higher risk blockchain than ETH for rugs at our initial launch. The cost of running a new project on BSC is significantly lower due to the lower cost in fees, large amount of transactions and the lower barrier of entry for inexperienced DeFi users and retail investors.

We may move cross-chain in the future on our mission to zombify the blockchain world, but we are beginning with the BSC.

## Can I make a suggestion?
