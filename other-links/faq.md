# FAQ

## How do I purchase $ZMBE?

Visit PancakeSwap at https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/\#/swap, and enter $ZMBE contract address \[INSERT ADDRESS\] and swap using $BNB. 

Additionally, you may purchase $ZMBE on our site at [www.rugzombie.io](www.rugzombie.io) using our exchange or zap feature when available. 

In order to interface with PancakeSwap you will need create a Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\) wallet with either Trust Wallet or MetaMask and fund it with $BNB to purchase $ZMBE and to pay network fees.

## How does the team select rugged tokens?

It is gravely serious situation when a project is “rugged” or deemed a scam. \(See what we did with that pun?\)

Our team has a process to determine what projects we will list in our graves and tombs. Some tokens are clearly a rugged/scammed project, some are dead due to developer inactivity or exploits from hackers.

Our team will consult a variety of elements as well as some trusted 3rd parties and partners \(stay tuned\) to know what projects to list as we know the act of declaring a token dead is a quite a serious statement. A few considerations our team has:

●  How long has the project been deemed “dead” \(this is an effort to avoid malicious attempts to rug tokens on purpose in order to rob our tombs of liquidity\);

●  GitHub activity and existence of rug-features such as migration codes, minting features, etc.;

●  Price action of the token, volume, liquidity, and on-chain information \(Some price action is quite normal, and we will work diligently to discern whether people are simple FUDding projects that are very much alive\); and

●  Community engagement and requests \(Eventually token holders will be able to vote to pronounce projects dead. We will call these funeral services, kinda morbid we know.\)

●  Post-Mortem analysis and 3rd Party audits on hacks, rug pulls and scams from trusted advisors. \(stay tuned for more information regarding this\)

## Why does your project have "rug" in the title? Isn't that bad form?

We chose the project name from a few others. Sure, there may have been a better name. There are certainly worse ones. We needed to capture both our undead/resurrection theme and remain clear about our mission to restore value to victims of rug pulls. 

We believe the transparency and hard work our team displays every day can give users confidence that we are accomplishing our mission: restoring value to victims of rug pulls, scams and hacks.

We may or may not discuss a branding change in the future as our ecosystem grows, but at the heart of our project is redemptive and restorative purpose.

## Doesn't your project inversely promote scams or rugged tokens? 

Not really. The reality is that due to our tokenomics and thoughtful selection process, hackers, bad devs and the like are unlikely to benefit substantially \(if at all\) from our project. 

The scammed tokens are generally used to verify you have rugged and do not require investors to own more than one of the token. This will hardly have any effect on most markets that have millions in circulation. In general, those who have not been scammed by certain projects will have little interest in that particular NFT as anything more than a collectible. 

Here are a few scenarios and examples to satisfy your minds: 

> example a: a flash loan hack that allows a hacker to control a major portion of the hacked token.

In this example, as in all examples, this hacker would have no way of predicting that we would open a grave for this project. And even if we were to list this project in our grave, the hacker's substantial amount of tokens would not benefit them as our graves use the rugged token as verification only.

> example b: a scam project intentionally soft rug pulls a locked liquidity token by dumping their developer wallet in hopes of getting a tomb listed on rugzombie. They use the robbed funds to buy $ZMBE to stake in a LP pair.

This would be an astronomically stupid idea. We offer no guarantees that any project will list in our graves or tombs. Dumping a substantial portion of their bags in order to buy $ZMBE and stake an LP would simultaneously raise the investor value of $ZMBE \(thereby rewarding victims of this "rug"\) and it would effectively take the rugged project out of circulation, decreasing open market supply and in addition provide extra liquidity for that token, thereby restoring some value to investors of the scam project. Simply put, they stand to gain more by not factoring $ZMBE into their evil plans. We are highly selective on which tokens will be in our[ TOMBS](../basic-information/main-features/tombs.md) and projects where developers are known to control a large portion of the supply are not eligible. 

> example c: a scammer/whale buys a substantial amount of the $ZMBE supply after a rug pull so that he can increase his voting power in hopes to push through his scammed project so that he can continue to manipulate price action on his rugged project.

Our voting feature is not yet built out, but rest assured we are dead set on restricting bad actor's abilities to continue manipulating their scam through our platform. This is the reason for our highly selective process and community voting is only in part what we use for selection. Specific voting features are coming soon in our roadmap. 

## Why Binance Smart Chain \(BSC\)?

Scammed projects are prolific in DeFi, regardless of the blockchain, as long as decentralization is around, there will be opportunists who want to act in bad faith. While ERC-20 tokens and DeFi on the Ethereum network are prevalent, we believe the barrier of high gas fees and greater costs to run a project on the Ethereum network means that BSC is actually a higher risk blockchain than ETH for rugs at our initial launch. The cost of running a new project on BSC is significantly lower due to the lower cost in fees, large amount of transactions and the lower barrier of entry for inexperienced DeFi users and retail investors.

We may move cross-chain in the future on our mission to zombify the blockchain world, but we are beginning with the BSC.

## Can I make a suggestion? 

Sure! Our team is very interested to hear from our community of grave-diggers \(that's you\). Please see our suggestion box to make your thoughts known, or just hit us up in the [telegram chat](socials.md).



Thanks for reading and Zombie On.
